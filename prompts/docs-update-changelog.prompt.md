When updating the changelog, consider the following:

1. Use semantic versioning for the version number (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 2.0.0).
2. Include the date of the release in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
3. Provide clear and concise descriptions for each change, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
4. Categorize each change appropriately under Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, or Security.
5. Review the changelog for consistency and accuracy before finalizing the update.
